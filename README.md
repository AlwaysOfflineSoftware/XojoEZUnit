XojoEZUnit
========

A Unit Testing framework for Xojo.Trimmed and simplified for rapid and easy unit testing.

## How to Use

You can simply drag the Xojo_Binary file into a project to import. Then try calling static functions (no objects required!)

ex:
```
XojoEZUnit.Assert.IsTrue(True)
```
More documentation is coming but my goal is VERY easy to understand and use!

## How to contribute

You can contribute to XojoEZUnit in two ways:

- submit changes from your Fork of XojoEZUnit
- request to become a Contributor

Don't send me emails with your updated project.

### Forking XojoEZUnit

1. Click the Fork button at the top.
2. Make your changes.
3. Push your changes back to GitHub.
4. Create a "Pull Request" for your changes.

I'll review pull requests when I can!

Frankly, this is all still new to me so we'll see how it goes!

### Becoming a Contributor

If you actively submit good changes, I'll probably make you a Contributor so that I don't have to process all your pull requests.
